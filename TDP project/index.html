      <p>Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language known for its clear syntax and readability. It's used in a wide range of applications, from web development and data science to machine learning and scripting. Python's large standard library and extensive ecosystem of third-party packages make it a powerful tool for tackling diverse programming tasks. Its emphasis on code clarity and ease of use makes it a popular choice for both new and experienced programmers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interpreted Language:</strong>  Python is an interpreted language, meaning code is executed line by line, making development and debugging faster.</li>
        <br>
        <li> <strong>Dynamically Typed:</strong> Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly declare variable types, simplifying the coding process</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="Differences_with_Javascript">
<header><h2>Differences with Javascript</h2></header>
<article>
<h3> Primary Use Case: </h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python:</strong> Primarily used for backend web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and scripting.</li>

<br>

<li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Primarily used for front-end web development (making web pages interactive), but also for backend development with Node.js, mobile app development, and game development. </li>
</ul>

 <h3>Execution Environment:</h3>

<ul>

<li> <strong>Python:</strong> Generally requires an interpreter to execute code. While browsers can run Python code with tools like Brython, it's not its primary execution environment.   </li>

<li> <strong>JavaScript:</strong> Runs natively in web browsers, making it essential for client-side web development. It can also run on servers using Node.js.  </li>

</ul>

 <h3>Syntax and Structure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python:</strong> Emphasizes code readability with its clean and concise syntax. It uses indentation to define code blocks.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Has a more verbose syntax, similar to C-style languages. It uses curly braces <code>{}</code> to define code blocks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Typing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python:</strong> Dynamically typed, meaning variable types are checked during runtime.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Also dynamically typed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Object Orientation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python:</strong> Supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Primarily a prototype-based object-oriented language.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python:</strong> Generally considered slower than JavaScript, especially in web applications.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Generally faster in web applications due to its just-in-time (JIT) compilation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By understanding these differences, developers can choose the right tool for the job.</p>

     <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World_in_Python">
       <header> <h2>Hello World in Python</h2> </header>
        <p>The "Hello, World!" program is a classic introductory program in any programming language. It simply prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console. Here's how it's done in Python:</p>
        <pre><code>print("Hello, World!")</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>print()</code> is a built-in Python function that displays output to the console.</li>
          <li>The text "Hello, World!" is enclosed in double quotes <code>""</code>, making it a string literal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To run this code, you would save it in a file with a <code>.py</code> extension (e.g., <code>hello.py</code>) and then execute it from your terminal using <code>python hello.py</code>.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Python_Libraries_and_Frameworks">
        <header><h2>Python Libraries and Frameworks</h2></header>
        <p>Python boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that extend its capabilities significantly. These tools streamline development in various domains, from web development to data science.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Libraries/Frameworks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Django/Flask:</strong> For web development.</li>
            <li><strong>NumPy/Pandas:</strong> For data analysis and scientific computing.</li>
            <li><strong>TensorFlow/PyTorch:</strong> For machine learning and deep learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are just a few examples; Python's library ecosystem is vast and constantly growing.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_Libraries_and_Frameworks">
        <header><h2>JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks</h2></header>
        <p>JavaScript also has a vibrant ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, particularly in the realm of front-end web development. These tools enhance interactivity and streamline the creation of complex web applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Libraries/Frameworks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>React/Angular/Vue.js:</strong> For building user interfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Node.js/Express.js:</strong> For server-side JavaScript development.</li>
            <li><strong>jQuery:</strong> A popular library for DOM manipulation (though less used in modern development).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These frameworks help developers create reusable components and manage complex application state effectively.</p>
